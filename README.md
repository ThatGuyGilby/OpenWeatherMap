## Summary
> This program is a test framework for the Open Weather API. The test framework makes an API call
> and retrieves an API (HTTP) response and retrieve a JSON file, which will then be
> converted into a Data Transfer Object by accessing each values of the JSON Objects inside the JSON file.

## Dependencies
> + JUnit Jupiter - For unit testing
> + IO Cucumber - For user story testing
> + Jackson and JSON Simple - For rest API functionalities
>+ Mockito - For mocking values in tests

> 6. Double-click the resources option to make a `resources` folder.

> 7. Create a file in the `resources` you made and name it `api.properties` and insert "api_key=" + your Open Weather Map API key

## How to use the project

> 1. Run all the JUnit tests and BDD tests to test the Open Weather API framework
> 2. Additionally, you can test it manually by running the `WeatherMainClass` or by doing the following
>> <p align="center"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/935470190127353868/947475119943581706/unknown.png"/> </p>
> 3. Create an instance of the ConnectionManager and HTTP Client
> 4. Get the HttpRequest through the ConnectionManager
> 5. Once the request is set up, you can then make an API call and get the HTTP Response
> 6. Then create an instance of the Injector class
> 7. Use the injector class to make a Data Transfer Object by passing in the HTTP Response
> 8. Finally, print out the injector class

## Classes

> + DataTransferObject
>> A class that follows a `design pattern` where it acts like a `data structure`, allowing multiple
>> classes to be stored in a singular class for developers and testers to have easy and fast access on specific
>> classes and attributes that the Data Transfer Object contains
> + ConnectionManager
>> The class which makes the Open `Weather API call` with the correct `API key `and receives the `HTTP response`
>> based off the current weather in the location given in the link. This class also provides the necessary methods
>> to extract the JSON `object/arrays and values` within the JSON file that the response returns
> + Injector
>> The class which takes in the HTTP response through the connection manager and convert the values
>> it gets from the JSON objects into the attributes of the Data Transfer Object class
> + Weather DTO attribute classes
>> Classes which represents the attributes of a weather, such as the `wind` class which has the attributes
>> of speed and degrees

## Testing and Outcome

> Automated testing:
>> We used the following practices for our automated tests:
>>
>> JUnit
>> 
>> Mocking
>> 
>> Assumptions
>> 
>> Cucumber - BDD
>
> Manual Testing:
>> We did a simple run down of the framework to ensure that it returns a DataTransferObject which
>> contains all the valid values from the rest APIs' response 
>
> Outcome:
>> Based off the product owner's requirements, we can conclude that we completed all the tasks
>> given both through automated and manual testing

## Project Tasks Management

> The team used Trello in order to manage and keep track of all the tasks from the requirements in this project
> where each task is assigned to at least one member of our team. Since the project is small, the Trello
> board will look smaller than usual
